# Lab 2 â€“ JavaScript Frameworks: Node.js & Modules

This project demonstrates the use of ES Modules in Node.js by creating and exporting custom utility functions from one JavaScript file (`functions.js`) and importing them into another file (`main.js`). 

The application includes:
- A greeting function
- A Celsius to Fahrenheit converter
- A factorial calculator
- A palindrome checker

Run the program using:
```bash
node main.js
